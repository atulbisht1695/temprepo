<h1>The story of the skeptic gerbil</h1>
<p>There once was a gerbil who didn't believe in humans. "Humans are just a myth", he would explain to every other gerbil in the gerbil tank: "how can you prove the existance of human caretakers? Have any of you ever <i>seen</i> one of these so-called "students" add food to the Holy Food Bin? No? Well, then why do you do all these rituals like spinning on the Eternal Wheel to appease the Teacher and Students you speak of? Wake up, ratple!"</p>
<p>Then all the gerbils died because none of the kids remembered to feed the gerbils over spring break.</p>
<p>The end.</p>
<p>The moral of the story: don't own gerbils.</p
